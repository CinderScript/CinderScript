            My name is <span class="lead">Gregory Maynard</span>, a software
            developer based in Seattle, WA. I have a background in computer
            science from Seattle Pacific University, where my interest in
            algorithms and design began. These areas have significantly
            influenced my work, especially in developing tools for game
            development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I first encountered programming through a Java course at Central
            Washington University, which led me to further pursue this field at
            Seattle Pacific University. My professional experience includes
            working with Java, C#, and Basic+. I find the .Net framework
            particularly useful and enjoy exploring its various tools. While my
            main focus has been on developing in-house interfaces, tools, and
            services, I also have experience working with Unity, which I find
            enjoyable and engaging.
          </p>

          <p>
            My approach to software development combines practical skills with a
            keen interest in the technical aspects of game development. I am
            committed to creating efficient, user-friendly tools and interfaces
            that enhance the gaming experience.
